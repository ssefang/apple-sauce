a. Include the current verison on the jQuery library
b. Wait for document to be ready to ensure all jQeury has been loaded in the page
c. Once ready, create an AJAX request to the json file provided

2. Create a paragraph set its content as below and append it to the existing header element
			Hometown: *homeTown* // Formed: *formed*

3. Create an h2 element and have its content be the current hero's *name*.
4. Create 3 seperate paragraphs elements have their content be:
			Secret Identity: secretIdentity
			Age: age
			Superpowers:
5. Create a ul element.
6. Loop through the current hero's *superpowers* — for each one create an li element, put the *superpower* as its content, then put all the list items inside the ul element from step5

6. Create an article element and append the 5 previously create elements (step 3,4,5)
7. Append the newly created article to the existing section in the html files
